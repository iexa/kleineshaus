# tinyhouse - a [simple] airbnb like app

- a fullstack react / typescript app using gql / mongodb
- i am adding my spin on it with minimalism by using:
  - vite / vitest instead of create-react-app
  - swr (v2) (or react-query) instead of apollo/client
  - wouter instead of react-router (or v6 of that)
  - dayjs (instead of moment dat library)
  - using playwright for testing?
